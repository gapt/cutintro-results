    Kill all external processes on timeouts.
    
    Apparently just killing the JVM won't kill the subprocesses.  So we now
    have a unified interface for calling external programs that
    
    * can directly write to stdin (this is not safe with Scala's Process
      class, so I have implemented it on top of java.lang.ProcessBuilder),
    
    * kills the process if any exception happens (ThreadDeath, OutOfMemory,
      ...) and also if the JVM exits,
    
    * can return both stdout and exit value.
    
    The new runProcess method should solve most of our external process
    troubles, hopefully.
    
    This commit also also adapts all non-testing uses of temporary files to
    withTempFile, which, just as runProcess, tries very hard to free the
    resources as soon as possible.
    
    Really fixes #377.  Also see #338.
